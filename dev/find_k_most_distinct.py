'''
Pick k points that aren't too close together algo:

1) pick a point at random
2) pick the point furthest from the first point
for (3-k): pick the next point with the largest sum of distances to all points in the picked set (aka heap)

Requirements: This function should take in a symmetric or half-filled numpy array (with other half across the diagonal being all zeros), and have k be a parameter the user inputs as well.
The output should be the indexes of the points selected, e.g. [2, 13, 18, 35â€¦]
